# What is CBC?
CBC is a network of computers which use the to atomically settle and record
transactions on a secure distributed database, the CBC Consensus Ledger
(RCL). Because of its distributed nature, the RCL offers transaction immutability
without a central operator. The RCL contains a built-in currency exchange and its
path-finding algorithm finds competitive exchange rates across order books
and currency pairs.

### Key Features
- **Distributed**
  - Direct account-to-account settlement with no central operator
  - Decentralized global market for competitive FX
- **Secure**
  - Transactions are cryptographically signed using ECDSA or Ed25519
  - Multi-signing capabilities
- **Scalable**
  - Capacity to process the world’s cross-border payments volume
  - Easy access to liquidity through a competitive FX marketplace

## Cross-border payments
cbc enables banks to settle cross-border payments in real-time, with
end-to-end transparency, and at lower costs. Banks can provide liquidity
for FX themselves or source it from third parties.

As CBC adoption grows, so do the number of currencies and counterparties.
Liquidity providers need to maintain accounts with each counterparty for
each currency – a capital- and time-intensive endeavor that spreads liquidity
thin. Further, some transactions, such as exotic currency trades, will require
multiple trading parties, who each layer costs to the transaction. Thin
liquidity and many intermediary trading parties make competitive pricing
challenging.
